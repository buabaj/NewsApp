# newsApp

A simple App for viewing News from the given backend. This is my submission for the QodeHub internship challenge and This was built with Flutter.

## Getting Started

First, fork and clone this project and navigate to the directory where you have this project installed. 
Open your terminal and run the command:
```bash
flutter pub get
```
to get all packages up and running on your local machine. The next thing is to set up your virtual or actual device for running and run the command in your terminal:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Directory Structure

assets: This is the directory where I kept the media files to be used in the project.

lib/data: This is the directory where I handled the backend data and preprocessed the parts of the data I will display in the app.

lib/screens: This is the directory where I created the screens that will be viewed in the app. It consists of the new list screen and the news desc screen.
